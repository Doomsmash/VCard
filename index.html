            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>After 3 years in the world of work, I realised that it was time for me to change direction.
                So far I have been working as a Sales & Back office for 2 years and I also did a year as a mortgage broker. 
                I was also able to do an internship in the event world at d-side group and more specifically at Brand first.
                In secondary school I took a course in Office Automation and Accounting. 
                I came out with a "very good" grade for my graduation work as well as a management diploma.
                I am currently training at BeCode.org in Web Dev.
